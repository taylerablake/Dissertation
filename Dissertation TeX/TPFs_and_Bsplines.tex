\section{{\outlineskeleton The Truncated Power Basis}}
\subsection{{\outlineskeleton Piecewise Polynomial Functions}}

Let $\xi = \left\{ \xi_1<\xi_2<\dots<\xi_{l+1} \right\}$ be a set of strictly increasing series of points, and let $k$ be a positive integer. Further, let $P_1,\dots,P_l$ denote a sequence of $l$ polynomials of order $k$. Then the correponding piecewise polynomial (pp) function of order $k$ is defined as follows:

\[
f\left(x\right) = P_i\left(x\right) \quad \textup{if } \xi_i < x < \xi_{i+1}
\] 
\noindent
for $i=1,\dots,l$. $\left\{\xi\right\}$ are known as the breakpoints of $f$. At the interior breakpoints, $\xi_2,\dots, \xi_l$, the function value is defined by specifying $f$ to be right continuous; that is, 
\[
f\left(\xi_i\right) = f\left(\xi_i^+\right),\quad i=2,\dots,l
\]
However, in a sense, without this specification, the function has two values at any interior breakpoint: the value it gets from the polynomial piece to the left of the breakpoint, $f\left(\xi_i^-\right) = P_{i-1}\left(\xi_i\right)$, in addition to the value it gets from the polynomial piece to the right of the breakpoint, $f\left(\xi_i^+\right) = P_{i}\left(\xi_i\right)$. To properly define the function, one can specify $f$ to be right-continuous:
\begin{equation}
f\left(\xi_i\right) \equiv f\left(\xi_i^+\right) 
\end{equation}

Denote the set of pp functions of order $k$ with breakpoints $\xi=\left\{\xi_1,\dots,\xi_{l+1}\right\}$ by 
\[
\mathcal{P}_{k,\xi}.
\]

$\mathcal{P}_{k,\xi}$ is a linear space having dimension $kl$, as it consists of $l$ polynomials, each having $k$ polynomial coefficients. The $j^{th}$ derivative of a pp $f$,
\[
D^jf
\]
\noindent
is a pp function of order $k-j$ having the same breakpoint sequence and constructed from the same $j^{th}$ derivatives of the polynomial pieces from which $f$ was constructed. This ``definition'' dodges much of the complicated discussion of the derivatives of a pp function at its breakpoints and thus must be treated with considerable care in context of the fundamental theorem of calculus.

\begin{proposition} \label
A pp function, $f$ satisfies
\[
f\left(x\right) - f\left(a\right) = \int_a^x \left(Df\right)\left(t\right)dt\quad \textup{for all} \quad x
\]
if and only if $f$ is a continuous function.
\end{proposition}

Consider a piecewise constant function $f$: by the previous definition, its first derivative is identically zero, and is therefore equal to the usual derivative of $f$ if and only if $f$ is constant.  

This prerequisite information is merely for the ability to responsibly refer to the set of piecewise polynomial functions and have a shorthand way of doing so. These means enable us to introduce two sets of basis functions: first, the truncated power basis, followed by B-spline basis functions. We will see that both are closely related, with the former having some properties which leave them unattractive for function approximation and thus present the construction of B-splines and how to use them to construct a representation of $\mathcal{P}_{k}$. In practice, one typically is given some information about an unknown function, $g$, and the task is to construct a function $f \in \PP_{k, \xi}$ which satisfies conditions that $g$ also satisfies, and in addition, has a certain number of continuous derivatives. These conditions define a subspace of $\PP_{k,\xi}$, $\PP_{k,\xi, \nu}$ for which we will need a corresponding basis.

For illustrative purposes, consider the task of smoothing a histogram using parabolic splines. Suppose we are given points
\[
\tau_1 < \tau_2 < \dots < \tau_{n+1}
\]
and non-negative numbers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_n$, with $h_i$ denoting the height of the histogram over the interval $\left(\tau_i, \tau_{i+1} \right)$. The histogram is an approximate representation of some underlying density function, $g$. Letting $\Delta \tau_i = \tau_{i+1}-\tau_i$, one may interpret $h_i\Delta \tau_i$ as (approximately) equal to the integral of $g$ over $\left[\tau_i, \tau_{i+1} \right]$. One may impose the following interpolation conditions on our smooth function, $f$:
\begin{equation*} 
\int_{\tau_i}^{\tau_{i+1}} f\left(x\right)dx = h_i\Delta \tau_i
\end{equation*} 
\noindent
for $i=1,\dots, n$. Let $f$ be a piecewise polynomial of order 3 having continuous first derivative:
\[
f \in \PP_{3,\xi} \cap \mathcal{C}^{\left(1\right)}
\]
Choose the breakpoint sequence $\xi$ to coincide with $\tau = \left\{\tau_1,\dots, \tau_{n+1} \right\}$. If $g$ is smooth and vanishes outside its support, $\left[ \tau_1,\tau_{n+1} \right]$, then
\[
g^{\left( j \right)}\left(\tau_1\right) = g^{\left( j \right)}\left(\tau_{n+1}\right) = 0,
\]
\noindent
for $j=0,1,\dots,d$, where $d$ characterizes the extent of the smoothness of $g$, we may also wish to require $f$ to obey two additional interpolation constraints:
\[
f\left( \tau_1 \right) = f\left( \tau_{n+1} \right) = 0,
\]
giving a total of $n+2$ interpolation conditions. These, along with the $2\left(n-1\right)$ continuity conditions yield a total $3n$ constraints on the $3n$ polynomial coefficients,
\[
c_{ji} \equiv D^{j-1} f\left(\xi_i^+ \right).
\]
These conditions lead to the system of equations:

\begin{align*}
c_{11} &  &  &  &  &  &  & =0  \\
c_{11} & + & \frac{c_{21}}{2!} \Delta\tau_{1} & + & \frac{c_{31}}{3!} \left(\Delta\tau_{1}\right)^2  &    &  =h_1\\
c_{11} + c_{21}\Delta\tau_{1} + \frac{c_{31}}{2!} \left(\Delta\tau_{1}\right)^2 &-c_{12}    &  =0\\
\;c_{21}\;\;+c_{31}\Delta\tau_{1}
\end{align*}
