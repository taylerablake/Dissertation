% To change the dissertation to a Master's Thesis, include a documentclass
% option such as [masters], [ms], [ma], etc.  Also available are [osudraft]
% and [twoside].  As a reminder, documentclass options are a
% comma-separated list, e.g. \documentclass[ms,osudraft]{osudissert96}
%

%
% Everything between the \documentclass and the \begin{document} is
% called the preamble of the document. Everything between the
% \begin{document} and the \end{document} is called the body of the
% document. Define any additional commands you want here (the preamble)
%

% BibTeX from the BiBTeX Documentation

%
% It is better to break up the dissertation into multiple files (e.g.,
% one file per chapter, as well as separate files for the abstract,
% acknowledgements, and vita).  These files are brought into the
% document using \include{} statements.  There will be times, however,
% when you don't want to print the ENTIRE dissertation.  You can limit
% what will actually be printed by using the \includeonly{} statment.
% This contains a list of the files you want printed.  Any file NOT
% listed will not be printed.  However, all page numbers, references,
% etc., will be preserved as though all the files were actually
% printed. For example, the line below would result only in chapters 1
% and 3 being printed (if it were uncommented).
%

%\includeonly{ch1.intro,ch3.implem}

% UPDATED TEXT (2010):
%  In the newest format, titles should be title case everywhere.
%
% HISTORICAL TEXT (1996):
%  In the new format, the titles of each chapter should appear in
%  uppercase.  In the TOC, however, they should be in lowercase.
%  The command below automates this behavior.  However, you'll have to be
%  careful not to include \labels within your \chapter definitions or
%  there will be problems.  If you don't want this to be automated, comment
%  out the \typesetChapterTitle definition below and do your chapters in
%  the form:
%  \chapter[MY TITLE]{My Title}
%
%  \renewcommand\typesetChapterTitle[1]{\uppercase{#1}}
\renewcommand\typesetChapterTitle[1]{#1}

\begin{document}

%
% First, declare the parts of your title page 
%

\author{Tayler A. Blake}
\title{Regularized Nonparametric Covariance Estimation via Cholesky Decompostion}
\authordegrees{C.S., D.S.}  % Degrees thus far, not including this one.
\unit{Department of Statistics}

\advisorname{Dr. Yoonkyung Lee}
\member{Dr. Kate Calder}
\member{Sebastian Kurtek}
%\member{Yet another dude}      % Normally you will have advisor + 2 members


%
% The following creates the title page
%

\maketitle

% Next, EITHER a copyright or BLANK page.
%
%   The following creates a page used to copyright your dissertation
%
%   BACKGROUND: Even without this copyright page, your dissertation will
%               carry a common-law copyright. However, if your
%               dissertation ends up seeing wide distribution, your
%               common-law copyright is at risk of being expunged.
%               Adding this copyright page prevents that from happening.
%
%               There are NO DOWNSIDES to including a copyright page as
%               your document is automatically copyright by law anyway.
%               However, this copyright page is OPTIONAL. If you get rid
%               of it, uncomment the \blankpage that follows it so that
%               there is a blank page here. The graduate school requires
%               a page here that is either blank or carries the
%               copyright.
%
%   IMPORTANT NOTE: The graduate school requires either a copyright page
%                   here or a BLANK PAGE here. If you get rid of the
%                   copyright, uncomment the \blankpage that follows it.
%                   You should NOT have BOTH uncommented.
%

% If you get rid of \disscopyright, restore the \blankpage line after it
\disscopyright
%\blankpage

%
% Abstract goes here.
%

\begin{abstract}
  \input{abstract}
\end{abstract}


%
% UPDATED TEXT (2010):
%  The graduate school does not require an external abstract. If this
%  changes, follow the old instructions below.
%
% HISTORICAL TEXT (1996):
%  Uncomment the three lines below to generate the external abstract.  Two
%  copies of this must be turned in to the graduate school.  These lines can
%  be placed pretty much anywhere, since the page numbering should be
%  independent of the rest of the thesis
%

% \begin{externalabstract}
%   \input{abstract}
% \end{externalabstract}

%
%  My Dedication
%

\dedication{This is dedicated to the one I love \ldots\ la la la \ldots}


%
% Bring in Acknowledgement and Vita from separate files named ``ack.tex''
% and ``vita.tex''.
%

\include{ack}
\include{vita}


%
% Make the Table of Contents and other good stuff
%

\tableofcontents
\listoftables
\listoffigures


%
% The following is a list of chapters.  Each is brought in from a
% separate file using the \include{} command.
%

\include{ch1.intro.v2}     % tell them what you are going to tell them 
\include{ch2.cholDecompostion}   
% describe the problem statement

%
% If you have appendices in your dissertation, you will need the
% following, else keep it commented. The following appendices are in
% files called ``app1.tex'', and ``app2.tex'', and they
% look just like any chapter.
%

\appendix
\include{app1}
\include{app2}


%
% The all important bibliography file at the end of your document!! Use
% the bibstyle you (your department) like in the \bibliographystyle{}
% statement and list the name of your bibliography database file in
% the \bibliography{} statement.  In this example, ``bibfile.bib'' is
% the name of the database.  See the LaTeX manual appendix B for details
% about the bibliography database and BibTeX.
%

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{bibfile}
