WHAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO USE "OSUDISSERT96"
(the 1996 Graduate School Dissertation/Thesis format)


To use the osudissert style, you will need to have

   1. LaTeX2e (obviously).

   2. osudissert96.cls


COMPILING THE EXAMPLE


The example is split into several files.  You should make sure you
have the following files:


         Thesis.tex        The main document. Run LaTeX on this file

         abstract.tex      The Abstract for the thesis.

         ack.tex           The Acknowledgement for the thesis.

         vita.tex          The Vita for the author of the thesis.

         ch1.intro.tex     Chapter 1 of the thesis.

         ch2.problem.tex   Chapter 2 of the thesis.

         ch3.implem.tex    Chapter 3 of the thesis.

         ch4.end.tex       Chapter 4 of the thesis.

         app1.tex          The first appendix of the thesis.

         app2.tex          The second appendix of the thesis.

         bibfile.bib       The sample bibliography database.


To fully compile this example, you should do the following:


   1. Run LaTeX on Thesis. This will do the inital compilation of the
document and will create a list of the labels and references made.

   2. Run BibTeX on Thesis. This will go into bibfile.bib and extract
the appropriate bibliography for the references cited in the
dissertation.

   3. Run LaTeX on Thesis two more times. The first time, LaTeX will
go through and (at the end) will recognize the references made in the
citations and will set up the table of contents.  However, the table
of contents will probably be off since the table of contents will
grow. The second time through, LaTeX will get the page numbers correct
in the table of contents.
